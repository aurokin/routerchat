                        &quot;Service&quot;). By using the Service, you agree to
                        these Terms.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Eligibility</h2>

                    <p>
                        You are responsible for your account and for any
                        activity that occurs under your account. Do not share
                        your credentials.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
                    <p>
                        You agree not to misuse the Service. For example, you
                        will not attempt to disrupt the Service, access other
                        users&apos; data, or use the Service for unlawful
                        activities.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Content and AI Output</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Service may generate content using AI models. AI
                        output may be inaccurate or incomplete. You are
                        responsible for how you use any output, and you should
                        verify important information.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
                    <p>
                        THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND &quot;AS
                        AVAILABLE&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS
                        OR IMPLIED.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
                    <p>
                        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ROUTERCHAT WILL
                        NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
                        CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF
                        PROFITS OR REVENUES.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Termination</h2>
                    <p>
                        We may suspend or terminate access to the Service at any
                        time if we reasonably believe you have violated these
                        Terms or if required to protect the Service or other
                        users.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
                    <p>
                        We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued
                        use of the Service after changes become effective
                        constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
                    </p>
